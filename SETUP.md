# Setting up Jedd

Jedd is a bot you text. You send it *"grab season 2 of The Bear"* or *"why is
the TV buffering"*, and it uses your existing homelab — Sonarr, Radarr, Jellyfin,
whatever you actually run — to do the thing and tell you what happened.

It is designed to drop into a stack you already have. **You point it at your
services; it does not install or manage them.**

---

## What you need before you start

**Two things are genuinely required.** Without either, Jedd cannot function at
all, and it will tell you so at startup rather than half-working.

| Required | Why |
|---|---|
| **A BlueBubbles server** on a Mac signed into an iMessage account | This is how Jedd receives and sends messages. There is no other channel. Jedd refuses to start if it cannot reach it. |
| **An LLM endpoint** — [Ollama](https://ollama.com) with a tool-calling model | This is the part that understands what you said. Without it Jedd starts, but every message fails. |

**Everything else is optional.** Jedd looks at your `.env` at startup, works out
what you have configured, and **only offers itself the tools it can actually
use.** A service you do not have is not a broken feature — the capability simply
is not there, and the startup log says which variable would turn it on.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env          # fill in the four required values below
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f
```

The four values you cannot skip:

```bash
OWNER_HANDLE=+15551234567          # your phone number — this is who gets admin access
JEDD_SEND_TO=+15551234567          # who Jedd may text. See the warning below.
BLUEBUBBLES_IDENTITY=you@icloud.com  # the Apple ID the BlueBubbles server is signed into
BLUEBUBBLES_PASSWORD=...           # your BlueBubbles server password
```

### 🔴 Set `JEDD_SEND_TO` deliberately

There is no default and Jedd **refuses to start** without it. That is on
purpose: the alternative to knowing who it may text is guessing, and the cost of
guessing is that it answers everyone who has ever messaged that Mac.

- `JEDD_SEND_TO=+15551234567` — only this person. Everyone else gets **silence**.
  Start here.
- `JEDD_SEND_TO=everyone` — anyone who texts it. Only once you trust it.

### ⚠️ `localhost` will not work from inside the container

The single most common first-run failure. In a container, `localhost` means
**the container itself**, not the machine running Ollama or BlueBubbles.

```bash
# ❌ these are the defaults, and they cannot work from a container
LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
BLUEBUBBLES_URL=http://127.0.0.1:1234

# ✅ Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows)
LLM_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434
BLUEBUBBLES_URL=http://host.docker.internal:1234

# ✅ or just use the host's LAN address
LLM_BASE_URL=http://192.0.2.10:11434
```

Jedd checks the model endpoint at startup and says so loudly if it cannot reach
it — including calling out this exact mistake.

## What each optional service buys you

Add these only if you run them. Each row is independent: skipping one costs you
that row and nothing else.

| Set this | And you get |
|---|---|
| `SONARR_URL` + `SONARR_API_KEY` | TV: search, add a show, add a season, fill gaps, check download status |
| `RADARR_URL` + `RADARR_API_KEY` | Films: search and add |
| `PROWLARR_URL` + `PROWLARR_API_KEY` | Release search behind the *arrs, audiobook and ebook search, indexer admin |
| `JELLYFIN_URL` + `JELLYFIN_API_KEY` | "What's on my server", who is watching right now |
| `QBITTORRENT_LAN_URL` | Find and clear stuck downloads |
| `TMDB_READ_TOKEN` | "What's popular right now" — neither *arr can browse, they need a title |
| `HP_ADMIN_SSH_HOST` | **12 tools**: docker ps/inspect/logs, restart a container, restart the *arr stack, diagnose host contention, live-TV checks |
| `HP_SHELL_SSH_HOST` | `hp_shell` — free-form read-only shell. See the security note below. |
| `KINDLE_SMTP_*` | **4 tools**: find an ebook and send it to a Kindle, plus address intake |
| `JFAGO_URL` + `JFAGO_PASSWORD` | Invite someone to your Jellyfin |
| `DISPATCHARR_URL` | Live-TV channel health |
| `IRC_EBOOKS=1` | A second ebook source besides Prowlarr |
| `RUNBOOK_PATH` | Lets Jedd read your own homelab notes when diagnosing |

Full descriptions of every variable are in **`.env.example`**, which is the
complete reference — every variable the code reads is documented there.

### 🔴 If you set the two SSH variables, make them different accounts

`HP_ADMIN_SSH_HOST` is privileged (it needs docker). `HP_SHELL_SSH_HOST` is the
account the *model* composes commands for, and it must be **unprivileged — no
docker group, no sudo.**

If they are the same account, that boundary does not exist, and Jedd
**refuses to offer `hp_shell` at all** rather than pretending otherwise. It
verifies this by actually running `id` over both at startup — not by trusting
your config. Leaving `HP_SHELL_SSH_HOST` unset is a perfectly good choice; you
lose one tool.

## How to tell it worked

```
[jedd] BlueBubbles 1.9.9 bridging you@icloud.com
[jedd] model OK: http://host.docker.internal:11434 has qwen3:8b
[jedd] SEND AUDIENCE: +15551234567 — everyone else gets SILENCE.
[jedd] tools=library_search, check_status, add_series, ...
[jedd] not configured, so NOT offered (3):
[jedd]   - homelab ssh (12 docker/host tools) — set HP_ADMIN_SSH_HOST
[jedd]   - ebooks to Kindle (4 tools) — set KINDLE_SMTP_PASSWORD
[jedd]   - whats_popular / title_details — set TMDB_READ_TOKEN
[bb] listening on http://0.0.0.0:18796/webhook
```

**That "not configured" block is not an error.** It is Jedd telling you exactly
what it left out and which variable would bring it back. A short tool list with
a clear reason is working correctly.

Now text it from the number in `JEDD_SEND_TO`. Try *"what's on my server?"*

---

## When it does not work

| What you see | What it is |
|---|---|
| Exits immediately, `JEDD_SEND_TO is not set` | Working as designed. Set it — see above. |
| Exits, cannot reach BlueBubbles | Check `BLUEBUBBLES_URL` (the `localhost` trap) and that the server is running. |
| `🔴 THE MODEL IS NOT USABLE` | Ollama unreachable, or `LLM_MODEL` names a model it does not have — the message lists the models it *does* have. |
| Boots fine, you text it, **nothing comes back** | Almost always the send audience: your number is not in `JEDD_SEND_TO`, so you are being deliberately ignored. Check the `SEND AUDIENCE` line. |
| A tool you expected is missing | Read the "not configured" block. It names the variable. |
| Homelab tools all fail | The ssh host is configured but unreachable — check `docker compose logs` for the identity probe, and that the key is mounted and the host is up. |

State lives in `./data` and is bind-mounted, so it survives restarts. Losing it
loses conversation history and any scheduled follow-ups.

---

## The one thing worth understanding

Jedd would rather **not have a capability than have one that fails when you need
it.** That is why a missing service removes tools instead of leaving broken ones
in place: a tool that exists is one the model will offer to a person, and being
promised something that then fails is worse than never being offered it.

So a small tool list is not a degraded install. It is an honest one.
