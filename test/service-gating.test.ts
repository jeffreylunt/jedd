/**
 * A TOOL FOR A SERVICE YOU DO NOT RUN IS NOT A FEATURE.
 *
 * Change 2 removed the ssh tools from a deploy with no ssh host. This does the
 * same for the *arr stack, Jellyfin, qBittorrent and Dispatcharr: a stranger
 * with only Ollama and Sonarr should not be offered `add_movie`, because there
 * is no Radarr for it to add to, and the failure would arrive at the moment they
 * asked for a film.
 *
 * ── 🔴 TWO OF THESE CANNOT BE GATED ON THE URL ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * `DISPATCHARR_URL` and `QBITTORRENT_LAN_URL` have NON-EMPTY defaults in
 * `config.ts`, so `if (config.dispatcharr.baseUrl)` is true for somebody who has
 * never heard of Dispatcharr — the gate would never fire and would LOOK correct
 * in review. Availability has to mean "explicitly set", the same distinction
 * `homelabSshConfigured` already draws. The API keys are different: they default
 * to `''`, so truthiness genuinely means configured.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ DISPATCHARR IS GATED ON URL ONLY, DELIBERATELY ────────────────────────
 *
 * Its username/password are unset on the live deployment and it works anyway.
 * Gating on credentials would have silently removed `channel_health` and
 * `livetv_status` from a working install — fixing a publication problem by
 * breaking somebody's setup. Presence of the URL is the signal.
 *
 * ── WHY SOME TOOLS DECLARE NOTHING ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `check_status`, `catalogue_search` and `library_search` span several services
 * and degrade PARTIALLY: with Sonarr only, "is The Bear downloaded" is still a
 * question they can answer, and "is Dune downloaded" honestly is not. Removing
 * them would delete a working capability to avoid a partial one, which is
 * over-gating — the harm the whole exercise is meant to avoid, pointed the other
 * way.
