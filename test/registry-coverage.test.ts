/**
 * 🔴 EVERY TOOL THAT EXISTS IS IN THE REGISTRY. QUANTIFIED OVER THE DIRECTORY.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `invite_to_jellyfin` was written, unit-tested, mutation-swept at 6/6 — and
 * then **never added to `buildTools`**, so it did not exist at runtime. Nothing
 * failed. 478 tests stayed green, because every one of them constructed the tool
 * directly. **A test that imports the tool it is testing cannot notice that
 * nobody else imports it.**
 *
 * `send_ebook` had the same hole at the same moment, and it is the one that
 * shows the shape of the trap: it had been **verified live end to end — a real
 * book reached a real Kindle** — through a script that built it directly. So
 * "it works" and "it is reachable" were both true of different objects.
 *
 * Both are factories that take deps, which is exactly the property that caused
 * it: every other tool is a module-level const and gets registered by appending
 * to an array in one file. A tool with deps needs a second file edited, and the
 * second edit is the one that gets forgotten.
 *
 * ── WHY IT READS THE DIRECTORY ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A hand-listed set of expected tools is the same class of object as the
 * registry it checks: something a person maintains and can forget. This walks
 * `src/tools/`, so a NEW tool file is covered the moment it exists — including
 * one nobody thought to add here.
