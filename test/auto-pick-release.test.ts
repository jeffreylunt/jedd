/**
 * NOBODY IS ASKED WHICH TORRENT ANY MORE — AND THE ONE WE TAKE IS CHOSEN ON THE
 * SWARM, NOT ON THE NAME.
 *
 * Jeff, verbatim: *"When downloading media, don't give users a choice of which
 * torrent to choose, just choose the best one."*
 *
 * ── 🔴 THE FIXTURE IN THIS FILE IS A REAL INCIDENT ──────────────────────────
 *
 * 2026-08-26 on hp: Sonarr had grabbed Fringe S02 from a pool of 2009 720p-HDTV
 * releases the quality profile approved. `time_active` 50–60 h, `num_complete`
 * **0**, **zero bytes moved, ever**. Every one of them read as respectable by
 * name. Blocklisting them and taking a 1080p AMZN WEB-DL — which the profile
 * REFUSES — finished in minutes.
 *
 * So `THE_FRINGE_SHAPE` below is not an invented edge case. It is the shape that
 * cost sixty hours, and the ordering that produced it is the one this file
 * exists to keep out.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ AND WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT TOUCH ────────────────────────────
 *
 * Which WORK someone meant is still their call, and the last test here pins it.
 * Robin asked for *"Don't Say Good Luck"*, Jedd asked *"the 2026 film or the
 * 2003 show?"*, and that question was CORRECT — they are different works and
 * guessing downloads the wrong one. Release choice is not title choice.
 *
 * ── 🔴 WHICH IS WHY THE BOOK TESTS BELOW NOW ASSERT ORDER, NOT ABSENCE ──────
 *
 * The rule above is a rule about copies of ONE thing. `search_episode` pins the
 * episode against Sonarr before it ranks anything, so it holds there and every
 * TV assertion in this file is unchanged. `search_ebook`/`search_audiobook` take
 * FREE TEXT and their candidates are different WORKS, so auto-picking there was
 * answering the wrong question — see `book-work-identity.test.ts`. The ranking
 * did not change and neither did what it ranks first; only whether the losers
 * are printed. Do not "restore" the `doesNotMatch` assertions.
