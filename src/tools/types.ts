   * further along, because the NEXT ssh tool joins the array and nobody

   *
   * Measured on a simulated stranger's deploy (Ollama + Sonarr, no ssh host at
   * all): **twelve tools that reach the homelab over ssh were still offered to
   * the model.** Nothing crashed. The bot booted, reported healthy, and every
   * one of those tools would have failed at the moment somebody relied on it —
   * which reads as a homelab outage rather than as "you did not configure this".
   * An ABSENT tool cannot be offered, argued for, or promised to a user.
   *
   * ⚠️ Unlike `writes` this is OPTIONAL and defaults to false, because "needs
   * no ssh" is the honest answer for most tools and demanding a declaration
   * from every author would be noise. The failure direction is safe: a new ssh
   * tool that forgets the flag is merely registered when it should not be —
   * the status quo — rather than silently disappearing from a working install.

   * 🔴 WHICH KIND OF STORED OPTION THIS TOOL RESOLVES A `choice` INTO.
   *
   * ── THE HOLE THIS CLOSES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * `add_audiobook` shipped registered, booting, present in the live tool line
   * — and UNCALLABLE. Its own description says *"Start downloading an audiobook
   * that an audiobook search found. Pass the number they chose."* **Nothing
   * produced that number.** V2 shipped the consumer without the producer, and
   * `send_ebook` was in exactly the same state.
   *
   * Every invariant we had passed. `registerable()` quantifies over
   * DECLARATIONS — `writes` declared, present in `ALL_TOOLS`, reachable from
   * `buildTools` — and the coverage test proves every `make*` export is
   * registered. **None of that knows about TOOL-TO-TOOL DATA DEPENDENCIES.** A
   * tool whose required argument is another tool's output has one, and an
   * orphaned consumer was indistinguishable from a working capability at every
   * layer we asserted on. It is the more instructive sibling of `add_season`:
   * that one was honestly absent; this one passed every green check.
   *
   * ── WHY IT CANNOT BE FORGOTTEN ───────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * The trigger is STRUCTURAL, not a declaration: a tool whose `parameters`
   * REQUIRE a `choice` is a consumer, read straight off its schema. Having
   * detected that, `registerable()` refuses to register it unless it says which
   * kind — the same discipline as `writes`, and for the same reason: defaulting
   * picks the convenient answer for an author who forgot.
   *
   * `'*'` means kind-agnostic and belongs only to `resolve_choice`, which is the
   * generic resolver and genuinely does not care.

   * 🔴 WHAT THIS TOOL'S RESULT DOES **NOT** COVER, APPENDED TO EVERY RESULT IT

   *
   * ── THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR ───────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * Measured 2026-08-28, live, n=10: asked *"has tom watched anything yet"* the
   * model reached `jellyfin_sessions`, got a **true but narrow** answer — two
   * idle sessions — and converted the scope of that one result into a claim
   * about the whole system: *"I can only see live sessions … that's not
   * something I can pull."* **80% of reps denied a capability the same registry
   * demonstrably holds** (`homelab_read` had answered the same question two days
   * earlier). The tool did not fail. It answered a narrower question than the
   * one asked, and nothing in its answer said so.
   *
   * ── WHY A RESULT AND NOT A DESCRIPTION, WHICH IS THE WHOLE IDEA ──────────
   *
   * Rewriting the tool's DESCRIPTION was measured on this defect at **p = 0.31,
   * not convicted** (18 live turns, 3 variants). A description is read *before*
   * selection, when the model is choosing among 37 tools and has no idea which
   * one it is about to over-read. A RESULT is read *after* — at the exact moment
   * the model holds a narrow answer and is about to generalise it. Same words,
   * different moment, and the moment is the intervention.
   *
   * ⚠️ **So do not "improve" this by folding it into `description`.** That is a
   * different experiment and it has already been run and did not convict.
   *
   * ── WHAT BELONGS IN ONE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * Three things, and the second is the load-bearing one:
   *  1. what this result IS (the narrow scope, stated as a scope);
   *  2. that its silence is NOT evidence of absence — the wrong inference,
   *     named and refused, because that inference is the actual defect;
   *  3. WHERE the excluded thing lives, **by tool name**.
   *
   * 🔴 A name here is checked TWICE, because one check was not enough.
   * `assertNamedProducersExist` scans this field as well as `description` and
   * catches a RENAME OR DELETION IN CODE; it runs before `registerable()`'s
   * config filters and cannot see config-driven absence. A second loop at the
   * end of `registerable()` re-checks scope notes against the tools ACTUALLY
   * REGISTERED on this deployment. Either way, a note pointing at a tool that is
   * not there refuses to boot rather than telling the model to call something
   * that does not exist — which would be this very defect, pointing the other
   * way.
   *
   * ⚠️ **RULE FOR AUTHORS: name only tools registered unconditionally, or gated
   * exactly as this one is.** The check cannot tell "call `X`" from "`X` cannot
   * see this either", so a note that merely MENTIONS a conditionally-registered
   * tool refuses to boot on a deploy lacking it — a false boot failure on a
   * correct note. Lowercase, too: both scans are case-sensitive.
   *
   * ⚠️ Appended to every result that enters the MODEL'S HISTORY. That is the one
   * site in `agent.ts`, and it is NOT the same as "every call to `run()`" —
   * `followup-runner.ts` calls a tool directly and renders its content into
   * user-facing prose without going near it.
   *
   * ⚠️ Not the same thing as the local `scopeNote` inside
   * `src/tools/sports-fixture.ts`, which is a per-window string built by hand
   * inside `run()` and predates this field.
   *
   * ⚠️ Optional, and deliberately not defaulted-to-required. Most tools answer
   * the question they were picked for and a note would be noise; a tool without
   * one behaves exactly as before. The failure direction is safe.
