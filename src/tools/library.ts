/**
 * "Do you have X?" — and, for a show, WHICH SEASONS.
 *
 * ── 🔴 TWO SERVICES, ONE QUESTION, AND NO JOIN BETWEEN THEM ──────────────────
 *
 * Jellyfin knows what is watchable. Sonarr knows what is HELD, season by
 * season. Neither can answer this alone:
 *
 *  - Jellyfin says *"Fringe is in the library"* and cannot say that season 5 is
 *    absent, which is the half the person asking actually wanted.
 *  - Sonarr says *"S1-S3 complete, S4 6/22, S5 missing"* and does not know
 *    whether Jellyfin has finished importing any of it.
 *
 * **Both are asked with the USER'S QUERY, independently.** No code matches a
 * Jellyfin item against a Sonarr row — that would be a fuzzy join between two
 * catalogues with different titles, and a wrong join here reports one show's
 * seasons under another show's name. Two independent lookups against the same
 * question can each be wrong on their own terms; a bad join is wrong in a way
 * neither source could contradict.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ SONARR IS ASKED FOR EVERY QUERY, INCLUDING FILM QUERIES ───────────────
 *
 * Deliberate, and it is the Moneyball rule again: **nothing here infers a media
 * type from the message before looking.** A Sonarr listing that matches nothing
 * costs one request and produces no output; a type guess that gets it wrong
 * costs the answer. `catalogue_search` searches both catalogues for the same
 * reason.

 * `NF - Sesame Street (2025) (US)` with `Type: "Series"` — IPTV on-demand
 * entries from the Dispatcharr channel, carrying `SourceType: "Channel"` and
 * `LocationType: "Remote"`. The previous renderer counted all three and printed
 * `IN LIBRARY — 3 match(es)`.
 *
 * **That is a false ownership claim, produced by the tool rather than by the
 * model** — the exact class V1's prose guards existed to catch after the fact.
 * No fixture had `SourceType` in it, because nobody knew the field was load-
 * bearing until the live library answered.
 *
 * The discriminator is a field, not a name pattern: `LocationType: "FileSystem"`
 * is a file on disk. Matching the `NF - ` prefix would have been a guess about
 * one provider's naming, and would break the moment a channel is renamed.
