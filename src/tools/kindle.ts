/**
 * Storing someone's Kindle delivery address.
 *
 * 🔴 THIS TOOL ACCEPTS AN ADDRESS AND USUALLY REFUSES IT.
 *
 * That is the design, not a limitation. V1's model **fabricated an address and a
 * stranger received someone's book** — `someone@kindle.com`, which is Jeff's
 * real address with the middle of the local part removed, persisted for a
 * different user who had never typed one.
 *
 * A validator would have accepted it: it is a syntactically perfect
 * `@kindle.com` address. **No property of the string separates a real address
 * from a plausible fabrication**, so the check cannot be on the string. It is on
 * PROVENANCE — the value must appear verbatim in this sender's own messages.
 *
 * ⚠️ There is deliberately **no `send_ebook` tool yet.** The delivery pipeline
 * (Prowlarr → qBittorrent → SMTP) does not exist, and shipping a send tool that
 * cannot send would be the `request_media` mistake again: a tool that implies a
 * capability it does not have. When it lands, **it will take no address
 * parameter at all** — the address comes from this store, keyed by the handle
 * the message arrived on, so the model cannot supply what the schema will not
 * accept.
