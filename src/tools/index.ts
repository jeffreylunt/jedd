/**
 * Which ssh identity a tool uses is decided by WHO COMPOSES THE COMMAND TEXT.
 *
 *   model-composed text  → `config.shellSshHost`  (unprivileged, no docker)
 *   code-composed text   → `config.adminSshHost`  (privileged, has docker)
 *
 * `livetv_status` and `restart_container` run privileged, and that is safe
 * because their command strings are literals in this repo with only validated,
 * non-string parameters interpolated. `hp_shell` is the only tool where the
 * model writes the command, and it is the only one that must be unprivileged.
 *
 * If you add a tool that interpolates model-supplied STRINGS into a shell
 * command, it belongs on the shell identity, not the admin one.
 *
 * The docker tools (`docker_ps`, `docker_inspect`, `docker_logs`,
 * `container_netns`) are the reason the identity split costs no capability. The
 * shell account has no docker access at all, and none is missing: those reads
 * were never shell-shaped. Their command strings are literals here with one
 * hole, a container name, validated by `isValidContainerName` before it is
 * interpolated. 🔴 That validation is the entire defence on the privileged
 * identity — see `src/tools/docker.ts`.
