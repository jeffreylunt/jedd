/**
 * Is this actually a book, and one Amazon will actually accept?
 *
 * ── 🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT AN IRC FEATURE ─────────────────────
 *
 * The IRC source made this urgent. It did not make it necessary — **the hole was
 * already open on the path that ships today.** `resolveBookPath()` picks a file
 * by **filename suffix** (`fetch-file.ts`), and `sendToKindle()` attaches it with
 * no declared content type. Nothing anywhere reads a single byte of the file to
 * ask what it is. A renamed `.exe` from a torrent is attached and mailed.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. A "1080p HEVC" TV release grabbed on 2026-08-26 was
 * a **962 MB `.exe` with no video in it**, relabelled weekly to dodge a
 * blocklist. Bots on IRC are exactly as untrusted as an indexer, and neither is
 * more trustworthy than the other. So this sits in front of `sendToKindle` and
 * **both sources go through it** — it is not bolted onto the new leg.
 *
 * ── THE RULE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **Unknown fails toward NOT SENDING.** Anything not positively identified as a
 * book is refused and REPORTED — never forwarded, never silently dropped. The
 * caller is told what the bytes actually looked like, because "we threw your
 * book away" with no reason is its own failure.

 * arrives by email to the *sending* account minutes later, where Jedd cannot see
 * it. So attaching a `.mobi` means telling someone their book is on the way and

/**
 * 🔴 AN EPUB IS A ZIP, BUT A ZIP IS NOT AN EPUB.
 *
 * Checking only `PK\x03\x04` would pass every `.rar`-in-disguise, every archive,
 * and every renamed installer that happens to be zip-based. The EPUB container
 * spec requires the FIRST entry to be named `mimetype` and to contain exactly
 * `application/epub+zip`, which puts both strings at fixed offsets:
 *
 *   0..4    50 4b 03 04            local file header
 *   30..38  "mimetype"             first entry's name
 *   38..58  "application/epub+zip" first entry's data
 *
 * ⚠️ **DO NOT ALSO ASSERT THE GENERAL PURPOSE FLAGS.** The spec says that first
 * entry must be stored with **flags 0**, and real books in the wild are not. A
 * genuine `Project Hail Mary - Andy Weir.epub`, pulled from a live #ebooks bot
 * on 2026-08-26 and confirmed by `file(1)` as an EPUB document, has:
 *
 *   offset 6..8   16 08  ->  flags  0x0816   <- NOT ZERO. Spec says it must be.
 *   offset 8..10  00 00  ->  method 0        <- stored, as it happens
 *
 * So a validator asserting `flags === 0` would **reject a real book.** (Method
 * on this file *is* stored, so that particular assertion would have survived —
 * naming the wrong field here would send the next reader hunting a trap that is
 * one field over. The dangerous one is FLAGS.)
 *
 * Check the strings. Not the header fields. This is measured, not reasoned.
