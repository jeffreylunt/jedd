/**
 * Prowlarr — finding a release to grab.
 *
 * ── 🔴 WHAT COMES OUT OF HERE IS AN infoHash, NEVER A URL ────────────────────
 *
 * qBittorrent lives inside `gluetun-torrents`' network namespace and **cannot
 * reach Prowlarr**. Handing it a Prowlarr proxy/download URL fails *silently* —
 * V1 saw `pending_count: 1` and a torrent that never materialised. So a release
 * is only usable if it carries an `infoHash`, and the grab builds its own magnet.
 *
 * ⚠️ UPDATED 2026-09-04: a release without one in the JSON is STILL a candidate,
 * because `downloadUrl` REDIRECTS to a magnet that carries the hash — see
 * `resolveMagnet`. What remains true is the sentence above it: qBittorrent is
 * never handed a URL. It is handed a magnet, and the resolve happens here.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ PROWLARR IS SLOW AND HAMMERING IT MAKES THINGS WORSE ──────────────────
 *
 * Searches take 35–45 s on a cold cache, and repeated searches trip per-indexer
 * failure-backoff, which **temporarily disables indexers** — so a retry loop
 * degrades the thing it is retrying against. One search, a long timeout, and an
 * honest UNKNOWN on failure.

 * Turn a Prowlarr `downloadUrl` into a magnet, by reading where it POINTS.
 *
 * ── 🔴 THIS IS THE FIX FOR "THE BOOK IS NOT ON THE INDEXERS" ─────────────────
 *
 * Prowlarr publishes `infoHash` for The Pirate Bay and NOT for 1337x. Measured
 * 2026-09-04:
 *
 *     "Dungeon Crawler Carl"         6 rows, all 1337x,      0 with infoHash
 *     "Project Hail Mary Andy Weir"  3 rows,                 1 with infoHash (TPB)
 *     "Red Rising Pierce Brown"      8 rows,                 3 with infoHash (all TPB)
 *
 * Dungeon Crawler Carl is carried ONLY by 1337x, so the entire series was
 * unfetchable and the tool truthfully reported that nothing could be fetched.
 *
 * The redirect target carries the hash and the indexer's trackers, which is
 * strictly better than a synthesized `xt=urn:btih:` relying on DHT alone.
 *
 * ⚠️ `redirect: 'manual'` IS LOAD BEARING. Following it throws — the target
 * scheme is `magnet:`, which no HTTP client can fetch. The redirect is the
 * payload, not a step on the way to one.
 *
 * ── 🔴 THE MAGNET IS PARSED, NOT PATTERN-MATCHED, AND THAT IS A SECURITY RULE ─
 *
 * The Location header is third-party text that decides what gets downloaded
 * into somebody's library, and it reaches a privileged shell command line.
 *
 * An earlier version read the hash with an UNANCHORED regex over the whole
 * string, and `grabTorrent` corroborated it with a bare substring test. Both
 * read the same unstructured string the same loose way, so they were ONE check,
 * and this got past them:
 *
 *     magnet:?dn=xt=urn:btih:<40 hex A>&xt=urn:btih:<40 hex B>
 *
 * The decoy A lives inside the DISPLAY NAME. It is valid 40 hex, so it passed
 * validation, and it appears in the string, so it passed the substring check —
 * while the single real `xt` names B, which is what a client downloads. It would
 * have reported STARTED, and nothing in V2 would ever have noticed: the
 * audiobook path has no follow-up and no status check.
 *
 * So: parse the URL, require EXACTLY ONE `xt`, and anchor the hash pattern to
 * that parameter's whole value. More than one `xt` is refused rather than
 * guessed at — a magnet naming two torrents is not a magnet we understand.
