/**
 * LIVE MODE — V2 on iMessage, replying as Jedd.
 *
 * ── 🔴 THIS IS THE FILE THAT SENDS. READ THE THREE GATES BEFORE STARTING IT. ─
 *
 * `shadow-main.ts` cannot text anybody: it holds no client, its connector has no
 * send path, and it refuses to start with writes on. **None of that is true
 * here.** This process answers real people on Jeff's household thread, from
 * Jedd's Apple ID, and the messages it sends cannot be recalled.
 *
 *  1. **`JEDD_SEND_TO` is required.** `everyone` is the cutover value; a
 *     comma-separated handle list is the rehearsal value. There is no default —
 *     an unset variable refuses to start rather than picking the permissive
 *     reading for somebody who did not think about it.
 *  2. **The identity assertion runs before anything is served.** Ports 1234 and
 *     1235 share a password and an API shape, so a copy-pasted `.env` connects
 *     *successfully* to Jeff's personal iMessage. It throws; nothing catches it.
 *  3. **The webhook is deregistered on the way out.** A Ctrl-C that leaves a row
 *     pointing at a dead port is the 1.4.11 orphan: BlueBubbles delivers into a
 *     black hole and nothing fails loudly. Shutdown is part of the contract, not
 *     a courtesy.
 *
 * ⚠️ Starting this does NOT stop V1. V1 keeps running with its own webhook until
 * somebody deletes that row deliberately — see the cutover runbook. Registration
 * here will not touch it: a row on a different port belongs to somebody else.
