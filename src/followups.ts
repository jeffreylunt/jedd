/**
 * Durable follow-ups: the thing that wakes up and can speak without being asked.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS, CONCRETELY ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `shed_host_load` throttles qBittorrent and **nothing will ever take that
 * throttle off on its own.** The tool cannot wait: the fix needs minutes or
 * hours to be judged, and a turn that ends when the tool returns has not
 * finished the job. "A turn ends when the user has been told the outcome" is not
 * deliverable inside a twenty-second settle window.
 *
 * So this module is deliberately NOT a general scheduler. It exists to close a
 * gap in a specific shipped behaviour, and the kinds are a code-owned enum.
 *
 * ── 🔴 THE RULE FOR ANYTHING THAT WAKES UP ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **A follow-up that fires when nobody is listening is worse than none.** So
 * every record carries, written at the moment it was scheduled:
 *   - WHY it was scheduled (`reason`)
 *   - TO WHOM it must speak (`senderHandle`)
 *   - WHAT was observed at the time (`observed`)
 *
 * and the runner must **refuse rather than guess** when it cannot establish the
 * current state. An unprompted message from a machine that cannot say why it is
 * talking to you is noise; one that acts on a guess is worse than noise.

 *
 * Live instance from V1, 2026-04-02: a guest asked for *Peppa Pig* seasons 1-3.
 * The add was REAL — Sonarr shows it 8 seconds later — and V1 said *"I'll check
 * back in a bit and let you know when they're ready."* Five months on, seasons 2
 * and 3 have **zero files** and the user was never told anything.

/**
 * What an `ebook-deliver` follow-up is about.
 *
 * ── 🔴 THE DEFECT THIS FIXES, WHICH PREDATES IRC ────────────────────────────
 *
 * `send_ebook` grabbed a torrent and, if it had not finished, returned
 * *"DOWNLOADING — ... Tell them it is downloading and that you will send it once
 * it lands."* **Nothing ever followed up.** No scheduler, no job, no second
 * look. The user was told a book was coming and the process that would deliver
 * it did not exist.
 *
 * That is the Peppa Pig defect exactly, one flow over: *the add succeeding is
 * not the outcome — the user learning what happened is.* It was live on the
 * shipping torrent path, not something the IRC work introduced.
 *
 * ── 🔴 THE DELIVERY ADDRESS IS DELIBERATELY NOT STORED HERE ─────────────────
 *
 * Only the `senderHandle` is. The address is re-read from `KindleRegistry` at
 * FIRE time, for the same reason `roleFor()` is re-derived rather than trusted
 * from the record: a stored address is a delivery target travelling through
 * time, and this is the one path where getting that wrong means **a stranger
 * receives someone's book** — which has happened here once already.

 *
 * **Amazon's success is silent and its failure is out-of-band.** A refusal —
 * `E014 - Unapproved sender email address` is the one a new recipient actually
 * hits — arrives as email to the SENDING account minutes after the SMTP hand-off
 * has already returned a clean 250. Nothing inside the turn can see it, so the
 * person is told their book was sent and then nothing ever contradicts it.
 *
 * That is why the check is a follow-up rather than a step in the send: **the
 * evidence does not exist yet when the send finishes.**
 *
 * 🔴 `sentAt` IS THE LOAD-BEARING FIELD. Every one of Amazon's notices carries
 * the identical subject line, and the mailbox holds years of them. Without a
 * lower bound taken at the moment of the hand-off, a bounce from April is
 * indistinguishable from a bounce for tonight's book — the check would
 * manufacture failures for good sends.
