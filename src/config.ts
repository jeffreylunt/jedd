     *
     * 🔴 CORRECTION 2026-08-26 — THE SENTENCE THAT USED TO BE HERE WAS WRONG.
     * It said the API "is only reachable on the bridge address, from the host

     *
     *   GET http://10.0.0.10:8080/api/v2/app/version    -> 200 in 7 ms
     *   GET http://10.0.0.10:8080/api/v2/torrents/info  -> 200, 121 torrents

     * that is unreachable from here — the reverse of what was written. The
     * belief that there was no second transport is why `homelab-read.ts`
     * excluded qBittorrent entirely.
     *
     * ⚠️ WRITES: auth is NOT refused over the LAN either. Measured with a hash
     * that cannot exist, so nothing real could change:
     *
     *   POST http://10.0.0.10:8080/api/v2/torrents/topPrio hashes=ffff…  -> 200

     * exist. The spec records the same trap for real hashes — a BATCHED
     * `topPrio` returns 200 with every priority unchanged, while per-hash calls
