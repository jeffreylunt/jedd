   * keeps the port.

   * `selectedMessageGuid` + `partIndex` are the wire names, read out of the
   * shipped `app.asar` (`messageValidator.sendTextRules`) and then exercised
   * live. Two things about it are NOT guessable from the parameter names:
   *
   * 1. **It silently switches the send to the Private API.** BlueBubbles' own
   *    validator does `if (effectId || subject || selectedMessageGuid || …)
   *    saniMethod = "private-api"`, so a reply-anchored send goes down a wholly
   *    different path from a plain one — one that needs the helper bundle
   *    connected. `helper_connected` was **false** as recently as 2026-08-24, in
   *    which case this route 500s and a plain send still works. That is why the
   *    caller must be able to fall back, and why threading is never load-bearing.
   *
   * 2. 🔴 **A reply target BlueBubbles cannot find costs 120 SECONDS, not an
   *    error.** Measured: an unknown `selectedMessageGuid` stalls for exactly
   *    120s and then returns `500 {"error":{"message":"Transaction timeout"}}`.
   *    The cause is in `MessageInterface.sendMessagePrivateApi`: it polls the
   *    iMessage DB (`resultAwaiter`, `maxWaitMs: 60000`, exponential backoff
   *    that overshoots) for a message that is never written. **Nothing is sent.**
   *    A plain send with the same body fails fast or succeeds fast.
   *
   * So an anchored send gets its own, longer timeout. It is still far below the
   * server's 120s wall — the point is not to wait it out, it is that aborting at
   * the ordinary 15s would make every slow-but-fine reply look like a failure.

   * They are the only calls in this file whose whole point is that they must
   * never break a reply — so the temptation is to make them un-throwable right
   * here. That would be a mistake, because the swallow belongs in exactly one
   * place (`Presence`) and a subject that cannot throw cannot be used to prove
   * that its caller survives a throw. A test that stubs `fetch` to reject and
   * asserts the turn still completes only means something while these can
   * genuinely propagate. So an HTTP error comes back as a RESULT and a transport
   * failure comes back as a THROW, the same as every other method here.
   *
   * ⚠️ The timeout is short and separate from `this.timeoutMs`. A presence
   * signal that is 5 seconds late is worthless even if it succeeds, and holding
   * a request open for 15s to deliver one is 15s of an open socket bought for
   * nothing.

   * NOT — because `ChatInterface.startTyping` is the ONLY thing in BlueBubbles
   * that pushes the guid into `Server().typingCache`, and that cache is the sole
   * trigger for BlueBubbles' own stop-on-send. Moving start onto the socket
   * (`started-typing` → `ActionHandler.startOrStopTypingInChat`, which never
   * touches the cache) would look tidier, work in a demo, and silently delete
   * the last independent stop this design has. See `stopTyping` below.

   * ── TYPING. ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * Measured in the shipped bundle on 2026-08-25, BlueBubbles server 1.9.9
   * (`app.asar` → `dist/main.js`, i.e. the code that is actually running, and
   * still present on upstream `master` the same day):
   *
   * ```js
   * static async stopTyping(e,t){const{guid:a}=e.params;
   *   return await Fu.startTyping(a),                    // Fu = ChatInterface
   *     new Rh(e,{message:"Successfully stopped typing!"}).send()}
   * ```
   *
   * The DELETE controller calls `startTyping` and answers **HTTP 200
   * "Successfully stopped typing!"**. So the call reports success, `ok` is true,
   * `Presence.report()` returns early, and NOTHING IS LOGGED — while the
   * indicator is switched back on. That is not a theory: Jeff watched "…"
   * reappear for a beat after every reply, and BlueBubbles' own log shows our
   * DELETE landing 4ms after the message was written.
   *
   * ⚠️ `ChatInterface.stopTyping` exists and is correct. It is simply not
   * reachable from any HTTP route. The ONE reachable path to it is the socket.io
   * event below (`stopped-typing` → `ActionHandler.startOrStopTypingInChat(guid,
   * false)`), confirmed live against `127.0.0.1:1234` by BlueBubbles' own debug
   * log printing `Executing Action: Change Typing Status` for the socket call
   * and nothing at all for the DELETE.
   *
   * 🔴 THIS WORKAROUND IS PERMANENT. IT IS NOT WAITING FOR A RELEASE.
   *
   * The inverted line is on BlueBubbles' `master` as well as in 1.9.9, and the
   * bug was reported to nobody — Jeff was asked and declined, which is his call.
   * So there is no version to upgrade to that fixes this, and **an upgrade could
   * change the socket API out from under us while leaving the DELETE route just
   * as broken.** If the socket path ever stops working, re-measure the DELETE
   * route before assuming it was fixed: `POST` a typing indicator, `DELETE` it,
   * and look for `Executing Action: Change Typing Status` in
   * `~/Library/Logs/bluebubbles-server/main.log`. If that line is absent, the
   * DELETE is still a start.
   *
   * ⚠️ Do NOT "simplify" this back to a one-line DELETE because the verb reads
   * right, and do NOT move `startTyping` onto the socket to match. The
   * asymmetry looks like sloppiness and is load-bearing in both directions: the
   * verb is the trap on this side, and `typingCache` is the reason on the
   * other. Tidying either one silently removes a guarantee.
