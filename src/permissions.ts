 * which made `+448015550123`, `008015550123` and `9998015550123` all resolve to
 * the owner — a complete authentication bypass for anyone who can pick their own
 * handle. Its unit test used a one-digit-different number, which shares no
 * suffix, so the test was structurally incapable of detecting the bug.
 *
 * The rule now: strip formatting punctuation, normalise a leading `+`, and treat
 * a bare 10-digit US number as equivalent to the same number with a `1` country
 * code. Nothing else is equated. Two handles match only if they are the same
 * handle.
